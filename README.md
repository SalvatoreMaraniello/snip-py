# snip-py
A collection of snippets, notes, examples and links for Python developers and data scientist/analysts.

## Setup
This requires python 3.11.4 or higher. You can use `pyenv` to manage python versions. 

- Examples regarding pure python (mostly inspired from (Fluent Python)[https://github.com/fluentpython/example-code-2e]), do not require any external package.

- For examples related to common python libraries, (e.g. `pandas`, `plotly`, `seaborn`), build a python environment as:
    ```sh
    ENV_NAME=venv
    python -m venv $ENV_NAME
    source ${ENV_NAME}/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Documentation and testing

## Recognitions
