# --- 1. Define Key Hyperparameters ---

# EMBEDDING_DIM: The size of the vector for each character. This learns a dense
# representation for each character, capturing semantic relationships. A larger
# dimension can capture more complex relationships but increases model size.
EMBEDDING_DIM = 256

# RNN_UNITS: The number of units in the GRU layer. This defines the model's
# "memory" or capacity to remember information from previous timesteps in a
# sequence. More units can handle more complex patterns but increase the
# risk of overfitting and slow down training.
RNN_UNITS = 1024


# --- 2. Note: the following hyperparameters are not needed / set yet.

# VOCAB_SIZE: The total number of unique words/characters/token in your vocabulary.
# This is crucial because the model can only process words it has seen during training.
# It determines the input dimension of the Embedding layer (e.g., if you have 10,000 unique words, this is 10000).
#Â This param is not set here but is an input for the model (and we will set this based on the sample
# text used for training)
# VOCAB_SIZE = len(vocab)

# MAX_LENGTH (int): The maximum length of the input sequences. This is only needed if using the
# Sequential API. But as we are building a sequence to sequence model (we are using teacher forcing),
# we won't do this. 
# All text inputs will be padded or truncated to this fixed length. RNNs require
# inputs to have a consistent shape, so this parameter is essential.


# --- 3. Build the Custom RNN Model using tf.keras.Model ---
# Subclassing tf.keras.Model gives full control over the model's forward pass,
# which is essential for custom training and inference logic.
