# Readme

This folder contains labs and documentation from the google courses:

- [Vector Search and Embeddings](https://partner.skills.google/paths/164/course_templates/939)
  - labs 00 and 01.

- [Custom Search with Embeddings in Vertex AI](https://partner.skills.google/paths/164/course_templates/948)
  - labs 03 onwards

The documentation has been re-organised by collecting all the theory related to embedding into [00a-docs-theory-on-embeddings.ipynb](00a-docs-theory-on-embeddings.ipynb).
